        <h1>Central Singularity</h1>
        <p>Singularity (Tekillik) <p>

 <p>Definition: <p>
 <p>Singularity is the fundamental state of pure existence within this belief system. It is an eternal and unchanging state, existing beyond time, space, and all physical forms. In Singularity, all forms of knowledge, consciousness, and essence converge into a unified, undifferentiated presence. <p>

 <p>Nature of Singularity: <p>
 <p>Unlike states of being or non-being, Singularity does not engage in interaction or separation. It is not a being with desires, emotions, or consciousness as humans understand it, but rather a state of absolute presence. Singularity is the ultimate origin, a state of complete unity where all things find their root but no duality exists. <p>

 <p>Relation to Existence: <p>
 <p>While Singularity remains unaffected, the collective contributions and energies from “being” eventually contribute to the evolution of this foundational state. In moments of cosmic re-creation, the data and experiences embedded in Singularity shape new cycles of existence.</p>
